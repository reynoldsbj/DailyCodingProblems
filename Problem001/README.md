# Daily Coding Problem #1
**Difficulty Rating: EASY**

Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.

This problem was recently asked by Google.

Given a list of numbers and a number k, return whether any two numbers from the list add up to k.

For example, given[10, 15, 3, 7] and k of 17, return true since 10 + 7 is 17.

Bonus: Can you do this in one pass?

## Solution Notes
For this problem, I came up with three solutions, BruteForce, BetterTimeComplexity, and BonusSolution. BruteForce was obviously the worst and BonusSolution was obviously for the bonus, but I also included BetterTimeComplexity because it had better time complexity than BruteForce and better space complexity than BonusSolution; it would be the preferred solution if space complexity were a concern.

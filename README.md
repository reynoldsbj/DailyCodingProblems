# DailyCodingProblems
This repository cotains my solutions for each of the daily coding problems from https://www.dailycodingproblem.com/ as I work through them. 

## Development Strategy
With each problem, I will go through these steps:
1. Add a static SolveProblem method which returns a value of type relative to the expected value.
2. Add a test class with a series of tests to evaluate the accuracy of my solution.
3. Write another method called BruteForce which solves the problem in the most direct approach possible, call it from SolveProblem, and run tests.
4. If that is not the best or desired solution, add additional method(s) and test them in the same manner until the desired solution is found.

## Complexity
For each solution method, I will include a time complexity and space complexity analysis. Note that sometimes the desired solution may have the best time complexity but not the best space complexity, or vice-versa. Doing things this way will give me better insight into solutions that might be used under different constraints.

## Problem Descriptions
The problem description for each problem will be detailed in the comments of each SolveProblem method.
